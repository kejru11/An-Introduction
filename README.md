# An-Introduction

Hi, my name is Kunal Kejriwal, and I am an undergraduate student at National Institute of Technology, Delhi. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering, and Computer Science related fields are my area of interest. 

I have been a professional content writer for over 6 years, and I have been actively developing technical content for more than 5 years now. I have loads of industry experience writing SOPs, API documentations, user manuals, whitepapers, technical guides, and press releases. 

My education & previous professional experiences have allowed me to author clear, easy to understand, informative, and in-depth documents in the following areas of technology: 
    
      AI & ML: Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Neural Networks, etc. 
      Programming Languages: C, C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, R, etc. 
      DevOps: K8s, Jenkins, Docker, AWS, CICD, Ansible, etc. 
      Ethical Hacking: Kali Linux, KeyLogger, Web Crawlers, Backdoor, Cross-Site Scripting(XSS), URL Direction, HTML Injection, etc. 
      Frontend & Backend Development: MERN Stack, MEAN Stack, MEVN Stack, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, RestAPI, etc. 

If your work revolves around any of the above technologies, I can help you author technical articles that are informative, but simple at the same time, so that they can be understood by everyone, even by those with little technological knowledge.
